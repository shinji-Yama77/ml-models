# Diabetes Project

In this project, I will be creating a logistic binary classification model for predicting the likelihood of the presence of diabetes in a person. At the end of this project, I will be deploying the model. I will be not be implementing scikit models, rather I will be hand coding gradient descent implementation by hand. 

Before performing gradient descent, I will be first doing baseline level exploratory analysis.
